            <h2>Why Tiling is a Good Option</h2>
            <p>
                There is a large selection when it comes to what tiles your looking for.<br><br>Some including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Porcelain</li>
                <li>Ceramic</li>
                <li>Marble</li>
                <li>Tavertine</li>
                <li>Limestone</li>
                <li>Slate</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Using tiles is a great choice because they are very durable, and have lower maintenance than other flooring options. They are easier
 to clean and preserve. They are water resistant making them ideal for places such as kitchens and bathrooms.
 The variety of options makes it so that they come in different colors, textures, and more so they look good in
 any environment. They don't gather mold, dust mites, or even allergens which can contribute to better air quality.
