        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            My stepdad has been flooring ceramic tiles and wooden floors for years as a professional.
 He has done many projects and always followed through with it and I have helped and
 seen what he has done. He has completed jobs in people's living rooms, businesses,
 and even college campuses. His only way of finding people is through word of mouth but with
 this website, he will be able to share and promote his business to other clients more easily.
