            Volleyball is a sport where there are two teams of six people. There are many aspects to the game ranging from 
            playing casually with some friends to playing competitively against a rival team. The main goal of the game is to
            keep the ball from touching the ground on your side of the net and scoring by hitting the ground of the opposing team.
            This sport is often played either indoors, outdoors in the sand, or even in the water as a friendly game.
            </p>

            Volleyball is a widely loved sport both in a competitive scene and casually. On this topic I will be focusing more 
            on the competitive side of volleyball. Playing volleyball can take a lot out of you especially because it required 
            you to be quick thinking, a team player, have well communication with your teammates, as well as being aware of 
            your surroundings. Teams tend to analyze their opponents before matches in order to prepare for the best strategy 
            to take them down.

                        Since division I is the most competitive division, it is the longest season because they end up having to play much earlier than the other divisions.
                        This makes their schedule much more intense as well since they expect them to be the top players.

                        They do this so that they can put together teams of similar level to play against each other so no teams are being blown out of the water by another.
