            <ul>
                <li>C: The site is mostly being used with black and white text along with pictures which make it easy to go through the list and find spots to stay at.</li>
                <li>R: You can see how just about all of their listing the text in bold are the locations and in gray are how far they are. You can also see in bold how much they cost per night.</li>

        <!--Bad sites-->
        <section>
            <h3><a href="spacejam.com/1996/">Space Jam</a></h3>
            <p>Legacy Space Jam was a website that has not been updated since 1996 so it has very old features and design quality wasn't the best.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C: The background of stars make it hard to read text in red that is included on the site and is not the most pleasing to look at overall.</li>
                <li>R: they use the same yellow text for each of the options to choose from.</li>
                <li>A: They align all of the options as planets but has a very limited selection on the site.</li>
                <li>P: The only thing they use to give each text their own "appearance" are grouping them with a planet or other picture.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>

            <ul>
                <li>C: This website uses multiple different colors and is hard to pinpoint easy to see text when it is all clunky like this.</li>
                <li>R: They box their multiple different listings and add their names in bold as well as mile in red.</li>
                <li>A: There is little to none alignment in this site other than seperating each of th elistings into box randomly on the page.</li>
                <li>P: After they group each of the listing they put a picture of what it is as well as the name and if applicable, the miles of the vehicle.</li>
